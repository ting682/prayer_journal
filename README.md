# PrayerJournal

This web app is used to create a journal for users to log in every day. This web app also contains a prayer wall so users can contribute prayers that they want everyone to pray for. This web application was developed using Sinatra with the following features:

* Persists userâ€™s journal entries using ActiveRecord one-to-many associations to postgreSQL database.
* Allows users to signup and login to the web application.
* Utilizes model-view-controller design pattern for object relational mapping.
* Encrypts user login data persisting salted and hashed password in postgreSQL database.
* Uses ActiveRecord model to validate user and journal entry data.

This app can be found via Heroku [here](https://prayerjournals.herokuapp.com/). A walkthrough can be found in [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZKlddr2upE&t=8s)
